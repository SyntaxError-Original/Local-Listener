Server/Client


The main aim of this script was to remotely control several of my Raspberry Pi's,One per CLI.

It will run on Windows/Linux ( only tried with Debian based distros) with Python installed. 

This is a simple command line port listener, that will run in Windows or Linux
and has a default port of 1234. This port can be over written on the command line
for example python3 local.py 4321 will listen on port 4321. 

You can also compiled into a stand alone exe with  PyInstller. 

Read the docs it is not hard  you will need the -F switch 

If you cant work out how to use PyInstaller then maybe you should not be using this script.


Hope you enjoy it.


Remember I am not a programmer just s guy that loves to tinker


Added the Client - 
        Just run this on the RPI, 
        Ensure it is on the same local network
        Edit the script to point to the ip of the Server
